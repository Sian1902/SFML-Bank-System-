# SFML Bank System

Welcome to the SFML Bank System project! This simple bank system is developed using C++ and the SFML library. It serves as a demonstration for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with SFML. The project is primarily intended for educational purposes, specifically for students at the Faculty of Computer Science at Ain Shams University.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to assist freshmen students with their Software Project (SP) assignments. By implementing this bank system, students can apply the concepts they've learned throughout their course in C++. Additionally, for the graphical interface component of their projects, students have the flexibility to utilize any C++ library that supports graphics, such as SFML.
